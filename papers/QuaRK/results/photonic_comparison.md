# Photonic adaptation: comparison with QuaRK

Simulated photonic reservoir (MerLin, 3 photons, 14 modes, threshold detection), same data, seeds and readout as QuaRK. Metric: test MSE at the validation-selected ridge; normalized = MSE / variance of the test labels; mean ± std over 5 seeds.

**Tolerance (frozen plan): PASS**

## Setup of every photonic configuration

Simulated, not hardware-executed; no photonic parameter is trained, so no gradient is used. Common to all: computation space: FOCK, occupancy_readout=True; detector: ideal threshold detectors (click / no click), no dark counts, no loss; postselection: none; encoding: phases pi (1 - 1e-6) tanh(Pi x_t) on all modes at each step, between copies of one fixed random MZI mesh; measurement: click patterns, reduced to 1- and 2-mode click marginals.
