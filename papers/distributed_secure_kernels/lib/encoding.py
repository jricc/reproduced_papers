"""Amplitude encoding as in the authors' ``library.py`` (paper Definition 4, Sec. 6.2.2).

A sample ``x`` becomes the n-qubit state with amplitudes ``x / ||x||``, zero-padded
to ``2**n`` with ``n = ceil(log2(len(x)))``, then reordered by one fixed
permutation drawn from the clients' shared seed (Python ``random.seed(42)``,
``random.shuffle``). Both clients apply the same permutation, so overlaps are
unchanged; it only matters for the circuit amplitudes.

Amplitude index convention: entry ``j`` is the coefficient of the computational
basis state whose qubit ``q`` holds bit ``(j >> q) & 1`` (Qiskit little-endian,
as used by ``QuantumCircuit.initialize``).
