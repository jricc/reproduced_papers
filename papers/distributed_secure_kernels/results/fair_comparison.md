Corrected protocol (oversampling and selection inside training folds), stratified 5-fold CV, mean ± std over seeds 0-4. Accuracy is the primary metric; balanced accuracy is needed for Framingham (majority rate 0.847). Quantum values come from an exact simulation, MerLin values from MerLin simulation; nothing ran on hardware.
